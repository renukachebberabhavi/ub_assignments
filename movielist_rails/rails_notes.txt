Create sample project:
	rails new easy-blog

Execute rails app:
	go to proj folder(easy-blog here)
	rails s //runs on default port 3000,if react and ruby runs together its better to change port number here
	rails s -p 3001
	Note: if no port is specified then it will run at 3000 port which is default.
	Note1:Browser don't show it bydefault, we need to open the link

Create hello world routes:
	1. Go to config/routes.rb
		root "application#hello"
	2. Go to app/controllers/application_controller.rb

			def hello
				render html: 'hello World'
			end

To link css with erb:
	 <%= stylesheet_link_tag "index" %> inside .erb file in <head> tag.

scaffolding:
	rails generate scaffold Article title:string description:string
	rails db:migrate //It creates table

	Note:Not recomended now, but for quick creation we can use

	rails generate scaffold Movielist name:string description:string director:string languagestring
	rails db:migrate

rails generate controller property


For Updating the Model:
	1. Create a Migration file
		rails generate migration property_links
	Note: Don't use create_links or anything with create unless you want to create something.
	2. Edit the migration file
		def change
			add_column :properties, :links, :string
    			add_column :properties, :tags, :string
		end
	3. Run the migrate command
		rails db:migrate

For creating empty record
	p = Property.new
	p.save
	Property.all


p.destroy
